 <h2><p>Do you want to be the best form of skarner, Say no more as this role is perfect for you. Skarner as a champion is slow and clunky which makes him impractical in multiple solo senarios. but throw him in the support role and he is now the best champ in the game, Spam qs at your enemy for &#913 lot of poke and punish with some 	&#8721; xtream amounts of cc with e and w if they push into you. </p></h2>
